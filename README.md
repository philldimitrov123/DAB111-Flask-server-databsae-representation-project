# DAB111 Project - Flask Database Representation

Welcome to my data base representation project! In this project we explore hotel booking data across several countries. The goal of this project was to showcase my ability to understand a dataset, succesfully use pandas to clean the data and manipulate the variables, upload this cleaned data set to a database, and finally display the data on a web server using the flask library.

# File Structure:
The Hotel database folder contains all the necessary files to succesfully run the application. In the templates folder we have the html templates for the Homepage, About, and Data pages.

# Dataset
The dataset originates from kaggle, link can be found below:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mojtaba142/hotel-booking

# Running the App
Below are the following steps to run the application succesfully:
  - Clone this repository to your local environment.
  - Select the Hotel database folder.
  - Install the required packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
  - Run the application by running python app.py in the terminal
